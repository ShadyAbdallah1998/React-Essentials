# React Essentials Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates core React concepts and was developed as part of Maximilian Schwarzmüller's React course. The application showcases interactive UI elements using components, props, state management, event handling, conditional rendering, and dynamic lists.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Built using React's component-based structure, making the code modular and reusable.
- **State Management**: Utilized the `useState` hook for managing dynamic data and updating the UI accordingly.
- **Props & Event Handling**: Passed data through props and handled user interactions using event handlers.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implemented conditional logic to display content based on the application's current state.
- **Dynamic List Rendering**: Rendered lists dynamically based on array data using JavaScript’s `map` function, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI and handling state management.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used for implementing logic and functional components.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShadyAbdallah1998/React-Essentials.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd React-Essentials
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Building and organizing React components.
- Managing state and rendering the UI dynamically.
- Handling user input and events seamlessly.
- Effectively using conditional and list rendering techniques in React.
